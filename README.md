# WinAPI Battleship Game

This repository contains a simple Battleship game implemented using the WinAPI (Windows Application Programming Interface) in C++. The game follows the classic Battleship rules, where players try to sink each other's fleet of ships by guessing their coordinates on a grid.

## Features

- **Graphical Interface**: The game provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the WinAPI, allowing players to interact with the game using mouse clicks and keyboard inputs.
- **Grid Layout**: Player's  ships are placed on a grid layout before starting the game randomly, and they can see their own ships but not the opponent's ships during gameplay.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Players take turns guessing the coordinates of their opponent's ships. Hits and misses are displayed visually on the grid.
- **Ship Sinking**: When a player's ship is hit on all of its grid spaces, it is sunk.
- **Winning Condition**: The game ends when one player successfully sinks all of their opponent's ships.
